# ThyEquationSolver
An equation solver program thingy that I wrote in my leisure time...

'TheEquationSolver' can solve liner equations and non-liner (quadratic) equations with no hassle. 
If you ever felt lazy and or wanted to see what happenes when you mix intermediate mathematics with a sprinkle of amateur python code then you have come to the right place.

If you have any other suggetions, be sure to let me know.

P.S I couldn't think of a better name...
